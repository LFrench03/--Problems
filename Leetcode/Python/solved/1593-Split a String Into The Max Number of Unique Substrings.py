#1593 Split a String Into The Max Number of Unique Substrings
'''
Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.

You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


Example 1:

Input: s = "ababccc"
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']. Splitting like ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'cc'] is not valid as you have 'a' and 'b' multiple times.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'ba'].
Example 3:

Input: s = "aa"
Output: 1
Explanation: It is impossible to split the string any further.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 16

s contains only lower case English letters.

Use a set to keep track of which substrings have been used already

Try each possible substring at every position and backtrack if a complete split is not possible

            if start == len(s):
                return 0
            max_splits = 0
            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                substring = s[start:end]
                if substring not in seen:
                    seen.add(substring)
                    max_splits = max(max_splits, 1 + backtrack(end, seen))
                    seen.remove(substring)
            return max_splits
        return backtrack(0, set())
